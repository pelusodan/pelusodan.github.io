For an Embedded Design course, I created a 2048 game in ASCII text in the command line controlled by a Wii remote on a Zed Board environment. The project involved writing shell scripts in bash that would connect the Wii remote through the Bluetooth pairing process automatically, as well as setting up the backend to handle the communication with the remote and game. For an added hardware twist, we added in the ability to track your highest tile value, using the LEDs on the Zed Board as base-2 value indicators. Check out a video we made on the process here:
