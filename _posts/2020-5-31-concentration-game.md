# Concentration
### A very shallow dive into the gorgeous world of iOS develpment
Recently a friend of mine offered a free iMac from 2012. I've never owned any
Mac products, and (am) currently employed as an Android Developer - but a free
desktop is a free desktop. Immediately I fell in love with typing with the magic
keyboard, and the UI of XCode development was simple to learn. Even after a fair
number of Etre Checks to make sure the hardware was ready, it's still a beast
when it comes to development. Many people say 'if you know Kotlin, you know Swift'-
I do think the language has it's quirks (as you'd expect from Apple), but as an
Objective C framework it does a great job prettying up the ugly stuff.

## The Course

This application pretty closely follows a Stanford iOS course I found for free
on iTunes U. The lectures were awesome, and I think it helps pick up the foundations
within a few hours.


## The View Controller Class

Below is an example of just how simple Swift UI controlling is. Even though Kotlin is incredible,
I can certainly understand the appeal of writing native iOS applications. I definitely do not think
this will be my last iOS app.

## Status

Right now the app only counts flips and flips cards, but part of the iterative learning
process is documenting your work. The app has one screen, and shows the same
emojis at the same locations as pictured below:

Stay tuned for more updates!
