In 2016 for my Eagle Scout project, I raised $15,000 to bring prescription glasses to Port Au Prince, Haiti.

The project was originally rejected from the National BSA for being too ambitious, costing too much, and completing work in too dangerous an area. Unfortunately, I was not willing to accept this rejection, and moved forward with raising the $15,000 without support from BSA. I completed the 1 week trip in June 2016 and gave over 600 individuals glasses. Here's a short video I made after the project to showcase the team's success.
