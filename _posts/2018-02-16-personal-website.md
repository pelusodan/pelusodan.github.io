This website is my first programming experience with actual publishing of static material using Markdown and Ruby. To display my material, I chose a GitHub pages site to host, with integration with Jekyll being pretty straightforward. I found a theme I thought looked nice and added in my materials according to the standard format. You can check out all my code in my repositories:
