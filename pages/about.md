This is a website I've created to showcase my projects. I am currently an undergraduate at Northeastern University where I study Computer Engineering and Computer Science. My interests are mainly in machine learning and software engineering, with a focus in Android development. Aside from school and work I complete projects for philanthropic and technical goals. In the future I hope to better document what I'm working on and share my work on this page. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks!
