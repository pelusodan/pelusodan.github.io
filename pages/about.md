This is a website I've created to showcase my projects. I am currently an undergraduate at Northeastern University where I study Computer Engineering and Computer Science. My interests are mainly mobile development (mostly Android, learning Flutter and iOS), machine learning, and backend software engineering. Aside from school and work I complete projects for philanthropic, technical, and musical goals. In the future I hope to better document what I'm working on and share my work on this page. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks!
