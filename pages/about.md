Thanks for stopping by! This is a showcase of the some of the projects I've worked on or am currently developing. I recently graduated Northeastern University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. Professionally, I work as a mobile developer for WHOOP. In my spare time I work on open source projects, write indie rock music, and complete philanthropy projects athletically. If not behind a desk or bike, I'm most certainly in the mountains.

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks!
